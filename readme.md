# Winfiles

My ['dotfiles'](https://dotfiles.github.io) and configuration scripts for Windows

## Purpose

### A 'mostly' Automated Windows Setup

Unlike better operating systems (ahem... Linux), Windows can't fully be configured
automatically. Well, simple installations might be able to but full desktop
configurations with disparate applications and settings is nearly impossible to achieve.

This is my attempt at making the setup of my machines as quick and "automatic" as
possible. There are still a number of manual steps I have to take and even the
"automatic" process is a multi-step affair. But, I can usually get a brand new Windows
installation up and running fairly quickly and **consistently** with this setup.

### Not just installation but config as well

This repository also contains my personal settings and configurations much in the same
way that `dotfiles` are used on Linux. In fact, a sub-module of this repository is in
fact my Linux\Mac `dotfiles` so that I can share some files between all systems.

During installation, the scripts will prompt for what "system type" the installation is
for. I offer two options, "Home" and "Work", which should largely be self-explanatory.
The primary difference between the two types are the mix of applications installed and
which settings are being used.

## Installation Overview

Full installation steps, including the manual portions can be found in
[Installation Steps](installation-steps.md).

In summary, the broad steps (particularly the automated parts) are as follows:

1. Install Windows & Run Updates (rebooting as necessary)
2. Open PowerShell as an Administrator
   - Run:
     `Invoke-Expression ((Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri 'https://git.io/fjBQX').Content)`
   - Or: `iex ((iwr -UseBasicParsing -Uri 'https://git.io/fjBQX').Content)`
3. Once complete, close PowerShell and re-open as Administrator
4. Once complete run: `.\01-setup-profile.ps1'
5. Once complete, close PowerShell and re-open as Administrator
6. Run: `.\02-bootstrap.ps1`, this will take a while
7. Reboot. Re-open PowerShell as Administrator
8. (Optional) Manually install the Chocolatey license file (see full installation steps
   below). It is a good idea to do this here rather than later as it will help the
   application installs be faster and more reliable.
9. Run: `.\03-app-installs.ps1`, this will take a **LONG** time
10. Reboot (again). Re-open PowerShell as Administrator
11. Run: `.\04-cleanup.ps1`

At that point the automated portions are complete. For more details and further (manual)
instructions, see [Installation Steps](installation-steps.md).

At this point you can run one or all of the optional "install packs" of applications. At
present, I support two packages: gaming and development.

### Option Without Running Web Script

The initial script run in Step 2 above will initialize Git and clone this repository. If
instead it is preferred to do that manually, you can. Afterward, you can start at Step 3
above from within the folder for this repository.

## Applications

I install as many applications as I can automatically using two different install
managers. [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) and [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/).

### Chocolatey

Chocolate is generally the first source to install an application. If both Scoop and
Chocolatey offer the same application, Chocolatey is used (with a few minor exceptions).
If Chocolatey is licensed (which does cost money but is recommended) it correctly
handles apps that self-update (such as Google Chrome and Firefox). If you do not license
you will be prompted for updates of those applications even though they have already
internally updated (which, in my opinion, is annoying).

### Scoop

Scoop is best for managing command-line applications or tools where multiple versions
may be needed (such as programming languages like Python, Ruby, Java). While the focus
is on command-line tools, when Chocolatey doesn't offer an installer for an application
Scoop will still be used as an automated install is always better than a manual install.
